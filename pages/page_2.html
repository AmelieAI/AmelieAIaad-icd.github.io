                    This geometry consists of rectangles spaced 1m apart along the x-axis. The rectangles have the same height and width but their orientation angle changes by a total of 90 degrees along the length of the resulting geometry, this creates a twist.

                    Object-oriented programming – As the name
                    suggests uses objects in programming.
                    Object-oriented programming aims to
                    implement real-world entities like
                    inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
                    etc in programming. The main
                    aim of OOP is to bind together the data
                    and the functions that operate on them
                    so that no other part of the code can
                    access this data except that function.

                    The word polymorphism means having many
                    forms. In simple words, we can define
                    polymorphism as the ability of a message
                    to be displayed in more than one form.
                    A real-life example of polymorphism, a
                    person at the same time can have
                    different characteristics.
                    Like a man at the same time is a father,
                    a husband, an employee. So the same
                    person posses different behavior in
                    different situations. This is called
                    polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
                    as one of the important features of Object
                    Oriented Programming.

                    <b>In C++ polymorphism is mainly
                        divided into two types:</b>
                    <br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
                    2. Runtime Polymorphism
